            <p>Iâ€™m a web developer who specializes in building beautiful and functional websites using HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. My background was originally in Engineering and Finance, but I decided to make I change when I
            moved to Canada, and here I am now, developing websites and loving it.</p>
